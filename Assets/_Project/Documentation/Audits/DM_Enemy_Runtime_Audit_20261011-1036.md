# Dark Matter Genesis - Enemy Runtime Audit

- Run: 2026-10-11 10:35:07 -> 2026-10-11 10:36:41 (complete)
- Unity 6000.4.11f1, scene `Assets/_Project/Scenes/Dark Matter Genesis v1.6.6.unity` (never saved by the audit)
- Menu/loading bypass: boot loader finished; state before bypass: GameSession not started, world frozen, timeScale 0, main menu visible, UITK_MainMenu/mainmenu-root still displayed, PlayerInput disabled (player not controllable); attempt 1: verified clean (phase=Playing, frozen=False, timeScale=1, loader=hidden, main menu=hidden, pause overlay=off, PlayerInput=enabled, cursor=Locked); Game view screenshot at first test step: A:\Dark Matter Genesis\Temp\DMAudit_first_step.png
- Player: Player_v7 Combat Variant at (-777.4, 21.2, -117.8), hp 1000.0/1200.0
- Player armed for the audit: weap2_sword drawn (vMeleeManager.rightWeapon = Drawn_weap2_sword); in-memory only, nothing saved
- Camera: set behind the player at spawn and re-seated after every teleport/movement step (vThirdPersonCamera); scroll-wheel zoom available
- Scene enemies deactivated for the run (runtime only): 1; spawner components disabled: 0
- Time.timeScale=1, runInBackground=True
- Enemy prefabs found: 1
- Unit store: 37 stored unit(s); stamps audit ABC1B1 game 26FECC gear E8CC0A; skip-unchanged is OFF (Full mode)
- Mode full: 1 unit(s) ran, 0 reused from the unit store (unchanged and previously passing)
- Excluded characters (broken, not used): Lisa_Hybrid
- Settings the audit changed (all restored at exit): Application.runInBackground False -> true -> False; stack traces for Log and Warning set to None during the run (were ScriptOnly/ScriptOnly, restored). Also (restored): InputSystem backgroundBehavior ResetAndDisableNonBackgroundDevices -> IgnoreFocus, editorInputBehaviorInPlayMode PointersAndKeyboardsRespectGameViewFocus -> AllDeviceInputAlwaysGoesToGameView (so injected keys/mouse work even when the editor is not the foreground window; Application.isFocused was True). Jetpack/dash/climb unlocked for the run by writing rank 1 into the in-memory skill ranks (skill_system_jetpack absent->1; skill_system_dash absent->1; skill_system_climb absent->1; restored at exit; no skill points spent, no save, no asset written). Nothing else is touched: no scene save, no ProjectSettings/QualitySettings/GraphicsSettings write, no timeScale change.
- Settings at start: runInBackground=False; vSyncCount=1; lodBias=2; targetFrameRate=-1; qualityLevel=3 (High); qualityRenderPipeline=Genesis_HDRP_High; graphicsDefaultRenderPipeline=Genesis_HDRP_Performance; fixedDeltaTime=0.0167; maximumDeltaTime=0.1
- Settings at end: identical to the start (no drift during the run)
- Main scene file Assets/_Project/Scenes/Dark Matter Genesis v1.6.5.unity: not written during the run (the audit has no SaveScene/SaveOpenScenes call)
- Mode: **full**, wall time 1m34s

**1 enemies audited - 2 FAIL, 1 warn.** Statuses: PASS / **FAIL** / warn (suspicious or inconclusive) / n/a.
**Overall (enemies + 0 weapon cases + 1 scenarios): 9 PASS, 2 FAIL, 7 warn.**

## Findings ranked by player impact

Ranked by what a player would notice (zero damage, dead/undead enemies, wrong weapons and AI first; perf and polish last). Identical causes are merged. Includes silent failures that raise no error.

| # | Impact | Status | Finding | Affects | Probable cause | Proposed fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 20 | FAIL | Immunity window (2s, no repeat chance interrupts) | SwordMaster | immunity timer not honoured | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |
| 2 | 20 | FAIL | Recovery lock (1.5s no new attack after an interrupt) | SwordMaster | enemy started a swing before the recovery lock ended | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |
| 3 | -5 | WARN | No stacking / circling (multi-enemy) | SwordMaster |  | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |
| 4 | -5 | WARN | vMeleeManager swing swish (PlayWeaponSwing on attack-window open) | Regression of earlier fixes and tweaks |  | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |
| 5 | -5 | WARN | Enemy melee hit on the player plays a hit sound (vMeleeManager.OnDamageHit -> CombatHitAudio) | Regression of earlier fixes and tweaks |  | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |
| 6 | -5 | WARN | Hot Cross weapon focus stays in sync with the equipped weapon (no revert to the first weapon) | Regression of earlier fixes and tweaks | no Hot Cross row ran (cached or scenario skipped) | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |
| 7 | -5 | WARN | EnemyInvectorLoadoutBridge: an override equal to the definition's item does not stick | Regression of earlier fixes and tweaks |  | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |
| 8 | -5 | WARN | No circling while unaware (patrol-anchor fix) on every enemy | Regression of earlier fixes and tweaks |  | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |
| 9 | -5 | WARN | Exactly one weapon drawn on every enemy (loadout bridge melee rebind / hide-unresolved) | Regression of earlier fixes and tweaks |  | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |

## Manual checklist (things only a human can judge)

- [ ] Weapon pose: the drawn weapon sits in the hand correctly (grip, no floating/offset blade) for every enemy.
- [ ] Attack animations look right and the visual swing lines up with when damage lands (no hits from a long way off, no whiffs while visibly connecting).
- [ ] Ranged enemies: muzzle position/flash and tracer origin match the weapon; aim looks natural.
- [ ] Idle/patrol/walk/run animation quality; no foot sliding or crossed-arm idle.
- [ ] Hit-mark art (decals, glow) reads correctly on the body type; hit reactions/stagger feel right.
- [ ] Death: ragdoll/dissolve looks right, loot bag pickup works, no weapon left floating.
- [ ] Audio: swing, impact, shot, hurt, death sounds present and not doubled.
- [ ] Difficulty feel: time-to-notice, chase speed and attack cadence are fair against the measured numbers above.
- [ ] Check the Game view during a run for any menu/loading overlay still covering the screen.
