# Dark Matter Genesis - Enemy Runtime Audit

- Run: 2026-10-10 20:54:23 -> 2026-10-10 21:04:23 (aborted: play mode exited before the run completed)
- Unity 6000.4.11f1, scene `Assets/_Project/Scenes/Dark Matter Genesis v1.6.5.unity` (never saved by the audit)
- Menu/loading bypass: boot loader finished; state before bypass: GameSession not started, world frozen, timeScale 0, main menu visible, UITK_MainMenu/mainmenu-root still displayed, PlayerInput disabled (player not controllable); attempt 1: verified clean (phase=Playing, frozen=False, timeScale=1, loader=hidden, main menu=hidden, pause overlay=off, PlayerInput=enabled, cursor=Locked); Game view screenshot at first test step: A:\Dark Matter Genesis\Temp\DMAudit_first_step.png
- Player: Player_v7 Combat Variant at (-780.0, 21.2, -122.1), hp 1000.0/1200.0
- Player armed for the audit: weap2_sword drawn (vMeleeManager.rightWeapon = Drawn_weap2_sword); in-memory only, nothing saved
- Camera: set behind the player at spawn and re-seated after every teleport/movement step (vThirdPersonCamera); scroll-wheel zoom available
- Scene enemies deactivated for the run (runtime only): 4; spawner components disabled: 0
- Time.timeScale=1, runInBackground=True
- Enemy prefabs found: 9
- Unit store: 0 stored unit(s); stamps audit 38522C game 0CC347 gear 204DA0; skip-unchanged is OFF (Full mode)
- Weapon matrix: 11 weapon items equipped one at a time (spawn override) on HumanoidEnemy_Invector; plus one dual-slot override case
- Mode full: 28 unit(s) ran, 0 reused from the unit store (unchanged and previously passing)
- Excluded characters (broken, not used): Lisa_Hybrid
- Mode: **full**, wall time 10m00s

**9 enemies audited - 0 FAIL, 9 warn.** Statuses: PASS / **FAIL** / warn (suspicious or inconclusive) / n/a.

## Findings ranked by player impact

Ranked by what a player would notice (zero damage, dead/undead enemies, wrong weapons and AI first; perf and polish last). Identical causes are merged. Includes silent failures that raise no error.

| # | Impact | Status | Finding | Affects | Probable cause | Proposed fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 75 | WARN | Ranged 'DM_Mining_Tool' damages the player | DM_Mining_Tool | damage was dealt although the item's damage is 0: it comes from a fallback (definition/ammo/projectile defaults), not from this item | Open the weapon prefab: hit box collider (isTrigger, layer), vMeleeWeapon.damage, hitDamageTags; confirm the attack animation sends the damage-window events; then re-run the matrix. |
| 2 | 70 | FAIL | Holding block negates enemy melee damage | Block + parry: player defends against enemy melee | player isBlocking never became true after holding RMB: injected right-click not received (Game view focus), stamina 0, or player in customAction/attacking | Verify the block input reaches the controller (isBlocking), meleeBlockDefenseHalfAngle, TryAbsorbBlockedMelee, and the enemy defense rate. |
| 3 | 45 | WARN | Enemy guard-break stagger after a blocked hit | Block + parry: player defends against enemy melee | no enemy hit-stagger observed after the block (DMEnemyGuardBreakStagger skipped: no EnemyInvectorRagdollBridge/attacker, or profile blockStaggerSeconds 0) | Verify the block input reaches the controller (isBlocking), meleeBlockDefenseHalfAngle, TryAbsorbBlockedMelee, and the enemy defense rate. |
| 4 | 45 | WARN | Enemy block reduces player melee damage | Block: enemy defends against player swings | player swings registered no hits on the open enemy, so the comparison is inconclusive (input focus, reach, or the player weapon) | Verify the block input reaches the controller (isBlocking), meleeBlockDefenseHalfAngle, TryAbsorbBlockedMelee, and the enemy defense rate. |
| 5 | 20 | FAIL | 'Death Axe' swing plays a swish | Death Axe | no AudioSource started during the swing: gameplay never calls GameAudioManager.PlayWeaponSwing (no caller), the weapon has no swing clip, or the attack animation has no sound event | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |
| 6 | 20 | FAIL | 'Spear of Fate' swing plays a swish | Spear of Fate | no AudioSource started during the swing: gameplay never calls GameAudioManager.PlayWeaponSwing (no caller), the weapon has no swing clip, or the attack animation has no sound event | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |
| 7 | 20 | FAIL | 'Spear of Fate' hitting the player plays a hit sound | Spear of Fate | weapon has hit sounds but nothing played on the player: vHitEffects.PlayHitEffects is only wired to vMeleeWeapon.onDamageHit and the audioSource prefab/Listener distance may mute it | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |
| 8 | 20 | FAIL | 'weap2_sword' swing plays a swish | weap2_sword | no AudioSource started during the swing: gameplay never calls GameAudioManager.PlayWeaponSwing (no caller), the weapon has no swing clip, or the attack animation has no sound event | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |

| 25 | -5 | WARN | Player melee swing via injected Mouse input (best effort) | Axe_Droid, Humadroid, Humanoid, HumanoidEnemy_Invector +3 more | inconclusive: injected input needs the Game view focused and a melee weapon drawn on the player; use the manual checklist if the receiver path above passes | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |

| 29 | -5 | WARN | Melee hit sound has a caller on the damage path | Audio: swing / hit sound wiring (static) | the only callers are the enemy-body receiver (PioneerInvectorDamageReceiver), MeleeCombatController and CombatHitResolver: damage TO THE PLAYER (PioneerInvectorDamageBridge / the player's vDamageReceiver) has no hit-sound call, so enemy weapons hitting the player are silent | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |
| 30 | -5 | WARN | Left Ctrl crouches | Player controls: WASD, look, mouse buttons, jump, jetpack, sprint, crouch, dodge, dash, switch | Invector crouch reads the legacy UnityEngine.Input through vInput (Active Input Handling = Both), which does not see injected Input System keys: this is a harness limit, not a game bug (the code-path row below calls cc.Crouch()) | Inspect the measured value and cause on the detail row. |

## Manual checklist (things only a human can judge)

- [ ] Weapon pose: the drawn weapon sits in the hand correctly (grip, no floating/offset blade) for every enemy.
- [ ] Attack animations look right and the visual swing lines up with when damage lands (no hits from a long way off, no whiffs while visibly connecting).
- [ ] Ranged enemies: muzzle position/flash and tracer origin match the weapon; aim looks natural.
- [ ] Idle/patrol/walk/run animation quality; no foot sliding or crossed-arm idle.
- [ ] Hit-mark art (decals, glow) reads correctly on the body type; hit reactions/stagger feel right.
- [ ] Death: ragdoll/dissolve looks right, loot bag pickup works, no weapon left floating.
- [ ] Audio: swing, impact, shot, hurt, death sounds present and not doubled.
- [ ] Difficulty feel: time-to-notice, chase speed and attack cadence are fair against the measured numbers above.
- [ ] Check the Game view during a run for any menu/loading overlay still covering the screen.
